Getting Started
==================


Installation
------------------
The installation is pretty simple if you have a virtualenv already installed on your machine. If you don't please rely to VirtualEnv official documentation.

.. code-block:: bash
    pip install digipathos


Visualization
--------------

Once you are done with the training of your model, you can use the module visualization_utils in order to create some visualizations from the generated weights.

Troubleshooting
----------------

In case of any issue with the project, or for further questions, do not hesitate to open an issue on GitHub.
